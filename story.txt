One day, Jerry and Gordon came to a forest and hunted for deer.
They found a bear in front of them.

"Oh no! A bear!" exclaimed Jerry.
"Let's get out of here before it notices us," whispered Gordon.
Just as the pair started to sneak away, the bear pearked its head up and let out a ferocious roar.

Jerry and Gordon both were frighten. Jerry decided he had enough of the bear and quickly reached into his backpack and brought out his 
.44 Magnum and a couple of shells. He fired a couple a rounds into the bear's chest, but the bear appeared unaffected.
Jerry gave out a loud shriek and decided to make a run for it. 

Having used all the rounds in his .44 on the bear, they stopped running
because they thought it had died. They went back to check on the bears body
but when they went back it was gone.
