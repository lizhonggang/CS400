One day, Jerry and Gordon came to a forest and hunted for deer.
They found a bear in front of them.

"Oh no! A bear!" exclaimed Jerry.
"Let's get out of here before it notices us," whispered Gordon.
Just as the pair started to sneak away, the bear pearked its head up and let out a ferocious roar.

Jerry and Gordon both were frighten. Jerry decided he had enough of the bear and quickly reached into his backpack and brought out his 
.44 Magnum and a couple of shells. He fired a couple a rounds into the bear's chest, but the bear appeared unaffected.
Jerry gave out a loud shriek and decided to make a run for it.
